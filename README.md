# Golang Test Server
___

This is where i'm storing a simple test service that i'm creating as I learn more about socket programming with Golang. 

Right now, Binds a listener to localhost on port 3000, logs to terminal status messages and repeats any message sent to it. 
I may tack on more functionality as I continue learning.
